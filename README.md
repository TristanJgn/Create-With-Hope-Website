# Create With Hope

This project was a freelance job where I had the pleasure of working with Hope who is a social media strategist. She owns a small business called Create With Hope where she works with businesses to help them grow their social media prescence, whether by gaining new followers, fostering better engagement, or a combination of both. Hope first started out with, and still runs, a vegan lifestyle page where she has grown her community to over 30K followers.

The website is hosting using a Managed WordPress plan on SiteGround.


# Build & Learning

I built the website on WordPress mainly leveraging a website builder called Breakdance. While I still added custom CSS to style the website and bits of JavaScript where needed, most of this project was a way to gain experience learning WordPress. The decision to use a website builder was driven by the fact that Hope wanted the ability to make small changes whenever she wanted through some sort of graphical interface as well as having Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the future for if she hires any employees. While it is possible to custom code all of these features, it was clear to me that by using WordPress and Breakdance, I would be able to offer all of the features Hope wanted in the most cost and time effective way.
